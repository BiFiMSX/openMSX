Release Notes for openMSX x.x.x (201x-xx-xx)
=============================================

A major release in which we finally migrated to SDL2 and Tcl 8.6.

Here's the list with all highlights and details:

MSX device support:
- added TODO
- improved TODO
- fixed TODO
- added new machines: TODO
- added new extensions: TODO

New or improved emulator features:
- WARNING: backwards incompatible change to the 'machine_info device <device>'
  command. The result for ROM devices is now a dict (instead of a list) with at
  least one key-value pair, with key "type". For certain devices more key-value
  pairs are present, that were previously in list elements 1 to 3. Example to
  get the mapper type of device 'usas':
  dict get [machine_info device usas] "mappertype"
  And to get the device type (works for any device) of MyCoolDevice:
  dict get [machine_info device MyCoolDevice] "type"

Build system, packaging, documentation:
- migrated to SDL2
- updated all other 3rdparty libraries as well, like upgrading to Tcl 8.6

And of course the usual various bug fixes and performance improvements.

In "doc/manual/index.html" you can find a set of HTML manuals for openMSX.
Make sure you read this if you haven't used openMSX before, but also to learn
more about the new and changed features.

CPU and graphics performance varies a lot, depending on the openMSX settings
and the MSX hardware and software you're emulating. Some things run fine on a
200 MHz machine, others are slow on a 2 GHz machine. For performance tuning
tips, see the Setup Guide.

openMSX is confirmed to run on the following operating systems: Linux, Windows,
macOS, FreeBSD, OpenBSD and NetBSD; on x86, x86-64, PPC, ARM, MIPS and Sparc
CPU's. Running on other operating systems (wherever SDL runs) or CPU's should
be possible, but may require some modifications to the build system. If you are
compiling on a new platform, please share your experiences (see below for
contact info), so we can make openMSX more portable.
